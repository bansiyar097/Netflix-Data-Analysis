### ◘ Objective
The primary incentive of this research is to:
* Process dataset by analyzing its integrity, missing values, duplicated values, and so forth.
* Perform various clean-ups, if required, and improve accessibility for more convenient exploratory analysis.
* Conduct exploratory analysis using a myriad of graphing tools to reach a conclusion.
* To reach a proper decision on which model to apply to the processed dataset in a future project to achieve the ideal optimization 
tuning and hopefully, a better outcome in the model's generalization.

### ◘ Approach
This research is classified into 2 steps:
1.	Data Wrangling: Where the dataset is extracted, tested, cleaned, processed, and stored in memory.
2.	Feature Analysis: Where the processed data is then explored thoroughly to acquire a viable insight.
